### Introduce Yourself
Throughout my career, I have successfully completed numerous projects that have honed my skills in full-stack web development, machine learning, chatbot creation across platforms like LINE, WhatsApp, Discord, and Telegram, as well as Web APIs and DevOps.

Currently, I am leading the development of the **Loop Project**, a Web3 initiative focused on integrating blockchain technology within the Telegram ecosystem. This project aims to create a decentralized platform that leverages the TON Blockchain to provide users with seamless and secure interactions. Our objectives include deploying smart contracts, developing a native token, and integrating AI-powered chatbots to enhance user engagement. By focusing on these areas, the Loop Project strives to contribute significantly to the evolving landscape of decentralized applications.
